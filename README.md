# Minecraft server

The server is made for a pleasant game with friends, without privates, just survival and do what you want.
The server uses the core [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), version of the game [1.19](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-beta---preview-1-19-0-20). So a couple of mods to improve the game on the server, as well as datapacks.

## Run server

```bash
./start.sh
```

## Install achievements

> To get started, start the server at least once in order to use this command!

```bash
./install.sh
```
